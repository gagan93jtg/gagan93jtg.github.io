&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hello everyone&lt;/strong&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m starting writing soon.

&lt;p&gt;I’ve started this blog to give back my learnings to the community. I’ve thanklessly contributed much less in the past, and was mostly occupied with my work. This was partly because I got a chance to work only in startup environments, where the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_to_market&quot;&gt;TTM&lt;/a&gt; is generally very less. In my &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.joshtechnologygroup.com/&quot;&gt;first organisation&lt;/a&gt;, I use to work on a product where the team was scattered between India and U.S. We synced once a day formally (as a standup) and spent rest of the day working on deliverables. This organisation was majorly “tech only” as most of us were engineers working on outsourced products. When I joined &lt;a href=&quot;https://loconav.com&quot;&gt;LocoNav&lt;/a&gt;, there was a major shift from service to product based and all the departments sitting under one roof. Accordingly, learnings were much different and ownership was now even more than 100% :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In past ~ 8 years, I got to work on multiple technologies, and even things outside tech. So In my spare time, I’ll write about topics that include (but are not limited to): &lt;strong&gt;Software Engineering, Culture, Leadership, and my specialization that is mostly in Ruby on Rails + AWS Cloud&lt;/strong&gt;. I hope that readers will find this content useful.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Gagandeep Singh</name></author><category term="hello" /><category term="welcome" /><category term="beginning" /><category term="blogging" /><summary type="html">Some brief around this post</summary></entry></feed>
