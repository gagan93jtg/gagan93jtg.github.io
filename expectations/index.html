    <p class="description">
      You must have landed here to know more about my professional side. I've tried to write down things that are not part of resume, and that I might forget while talking to you on a call. So here we go:
      <ul>
        <li>
          I believe in building things right so I dig into requirements deep enough that development teams have clarity on what to build.
        </li>
        <li>
          I have a rich experience of interviewing 200+ candidates of range 0-15 years. I can build teams if the HRs take care of building the pipeline (as I don't have a good LinkedIn reachout).
        </li>
        <li>
          With changing requirements, I have a habit to check the state of current code and scope of structural simplification. I keep refactoring classes for a better low level design.
        </li>
        <li>
          I build systems that can work without much dev intervention in the long run. This has allowed me to build a lot of things wherever I worked.
        </li>
        <li>
          If something is being manually done for a few months, there are chances that it will be used in future also. Better automate whatever aspects are possible. This allows saving a lot budget in the long run.
        </li>
        <li>
          I don't hate QAs but I'm confident enough to ship anything to production without involving QAs. I rely on test cases apart from manual testing. I do hate developers who rely completely on QA testing.
        </li>
        <li>
          I don't call myself 5x or 10x developer but I develop quite fast. I'm proficient with Ruby to develop anything on backend. I'm open to learn anything technical.
        </li>
        <li>
          I emphasize of efficiency in all aspects of my professional life. Much of what I want to write on my blog is around the same.
        </li>
        <li>
          I also emphasize on building simple products. Although it depends on the audience we're catering, but complex products are hardly used. The role of engineering (tech+product) is to create simple UX.
        </li>
      </ul>
