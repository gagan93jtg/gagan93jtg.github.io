## Hey!
I'm Gagandeep Singh, a Staff Engineer based out of  New Delhi, India. I've been a full-stack developer in the past but now I am primarily a backend developer. I primarily write code in Ruby, build websites in Rails and deploy them on AWS EC2, or dockers, or kubernetes pods. Devops has been a decent part of my journey so I've developed a decent expertise in cloud also (primarily AWS).

Though my role sounds very technical, but being a part of startup environment, it is not limited to only tech. Apart from my involvement in deep technical tasks, I'm also into handling people, hiring and trainning them, handling end to end delivery of features, acting as a project manager at times, and optimizing a lot of stuff that was badly written in the past by myself or by someone else.

I write here and on my LinkedIn handle in my free time. A detailed version of my work experience is shared [here](https://gagan93.me).
