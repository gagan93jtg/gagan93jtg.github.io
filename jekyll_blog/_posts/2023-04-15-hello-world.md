I've started this blog to give back my learnings to the community. I've thanklessly contributed much less in the past, and was mostly occupied with my work. This was partly because I got a chance to work only in startup environments, where the [TTM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_to_market) is generally very less. In my [first organisation](https://www.joshtechnologygroup.com/), I use to work on a product where the team was scattered between India and U.S. We synced once a day formally (as a standup) and spent rest of the day working on deliverables. This organisation was majorly "tech only" as most of us were engineers working on outsourced products. When I joined [LocoNav](https://loconav.com), there was a major shift from service to product based and all the departments sitting under one roof. Accordingly, learnings were much different and ownership was now even more than 100% :)

In past ~ 8 years, I got to work on multiple technologies, and even things outside tech. So In my spare time, I'll write about topics that include (but are not limited to): **Software Engineering, Culture, Leadership, and my specialization that is mostly in Ruby on Rails + AWS Cloud**. I hope that readers will find this content useful.
