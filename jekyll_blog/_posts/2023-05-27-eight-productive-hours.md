I'm a morning person. So I usually start around 8 AM from my home desk. The time was same even when I worked from office. Almost everyone starts after 9:30 or 10, giving me enough time for tasks that require strong concentration. I try to devote a part of this time to reading if my work-schedule allows (which it doesn't, generally). I expect some personal time in the evening, away from work so that I can take care of rest of the aspects of life (health & family mostly). Many people start late and take care of these things in the beginning of the day. In my opinion, both of the ways are fine. But I strongly emphaisize on the fact that one should just have a life outside work so that you don't get bored on weekends and holidays.

Reading the post title, you might be thinking that I'm talking about clearly separating personal and professional life. I've personally been part of only startups in my career, so this is not what I really mean. In fact, overworking is not only seen in startups, but in large organisations as well. Following is what I've learnt:

1. **Don't glamorise overworking** - Overworking might reflect a hardworking person for once but is not good in the long term. It sets wrong expectations, wrong culture, and makes you less ready for anything else. Your working days will be fully consumed if you become habitual of this. You will feel less interested in anything else, and might even start working on weekends as a result of this habit.

2. **Be responsible for your work** - If there is some code that you wrote, or some initiative you're driving, that needs your intervention during non-working hours (eg. production outage of your service/module), be available. It is no one else's duty. It's ok if you have an escalation matrix setup in on-call, but not ok otherwise. Take the lead, and fix it.

3. **Estimate well** - One of the reasons to overwork could be a wrong estimate (under-estimate). It's ok to do it as a fresher, but if you are an SSE and still not doing enough estimation, or taking buffers, you'll end up overworking. If the release manager doesn't agree to shift dates, no one can save you here. Do learn this skill.

4. **Be realistic about deadlines** - There are days when we're given very unrealistic deadlines. At times, they're achievable by putting more resources, but sometimes they're not doable. Be clear about it. Because, there are cases when we aim to achieve software delivery by thinking that everyone can overdo, but rather end up doing in 2x - 3x the promised time.
