    <span class="title">âœ‹ Hey there!</span>
    <p class="description">
      You must have landed here to know more about my professional side. So here we go:
      <ul>
        <li>
          I believe in building things right so I dig into requirements deep enough that development teams have clarity on what to build.
        </li>
        <li>
          I have a rich experience of interviewing 200+ candidates of range 0-15 years. I can build teams if the HRs take care of building the pipeline.
        </li>
        <li>
          With changing requirements, I continuously check the state of current code and scope of structural simplification. I keep refactoring classes for a better low level design.
        </li>
        <li>
          I build systems that work without much dev intervention in the long run. Although this seems much obvious, this doesn't happen everywhere.
        </li>
        <li>
          If a process is being executed manually for a few months, there are chances that it will be used in future also. I notice and automate such systems. This saves a lot budget in the long run.
        </li>
        <li>
          I don't hate QAs but I'm confident enough to ship anything to production without involving QAs. I rely on test cases apart from manual testing. I do hate developers who don't own test their systems well.
        </li>
        <li>
          I don't call myself a 5x or 10x developer but I develop quite fast. I'm proficient in Ruby language to develop anything on backend. I'm open to learn anything technical.
        </li>
        <li>
          I emphasize on efficiency in all aspects of my professional life. Much of what I write on my <a href="https://gagan93.me/blog" target="_blank">blog</a> is around culture, good code and efficiency
        </li>
        <li>
          I also emphasize on building simple products. Although it depends on the audience we're catering, but complex products are hardly used. I believe that the role of engineering (Tech & Product) is to create simple UX.
        </li>
      </ul>
